## git remote

Let's publish our *git-test* repository on github. 

Go to [github.com](https://github.com/). If you don't have an account there you could make one for free.

Github is one of the most popular services for open source projects as of now, but there exists others as well. Most notably [bitbucket.org](https://bitbucket.org/) which also let's you have private repositorys for free.

You could also host your own server to store remote repositories.


## git remote

On your github profile, go to the **Repositories** tab.

![Github repository]({{ "/assets/images/git-presentation/repos.png" | absolute_url }})
{: .image-frame}

And click the **New** button


## git remote

![Create repo]({{"/assets/images/git-presentation/create-repo.png" | absolute_url }})
{: .image-frame}

Create a name for your repository, and give it an optional description.

You can also choose if the repository will be public or private (the private option is only available if you have a paid account)

As we already have an exsisting repository on our machine, we will **not** initialize the repository with a README.

Finally, click **Create repository**


## git remote

![Repo setyp]({{"/assets/images/git-presentation/repo-setup.png" | absolute_url }})
{: .image-frame}

You will be taken to a screen with different suggestions.

As we already have an existing repository we will choose the second option: *...or push and existing repository from the command line.*


## git remote

Verify that you are standing inside your local repository in your terminal using the `pwd` command. It should display something like `/Users/you/Desktop/git-test`

Then copy and paste the lines from the github page (don't copy from this slide as the remote address will be something different for you)

```shell
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/you/git-test.git
$ git push -u origin master
```

That's it! You have now pushed your local repository to a remote repository residing on github. Refresh your browser tab to see the content of your repository.


# Updating


## git push

If we continue working on our local repository and commit new changes to it, we regularly want to update our remote on github. We do that with the `push` command.

Let's create a new file

```shell
$ echo "Some content" > another-file
$ git add another-file
$ git commit -m "Add another file"
```
And push it to our remote (i.e. github)

```shell
$ git push
```
