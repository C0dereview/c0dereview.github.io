Hi I'm [Daniel](http://danielmkarlsson.com/) and I live in Stockholm, Sweden on the most densely populated island in the country.  
In the one bed room apartment that I share w/ one other person there is: 

- A kitchen
- An ok computer monitor 
- A crappy home stereo

Because I had access to these things and, the crucial component, I wanted to, I created C0dereview.

## C0dereview is a thing
C0dereview exists in order to facilitate sharing. In more practical terms it's a weekly chance for some people I know to meet, have a nice meal together and to share knowledge about their work with music, code and configuring computers. This usually happens on Thursdays at 17:00.
