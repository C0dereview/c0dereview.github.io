### C0dereview is a thing

C0dereview is a framework designed to facilitate sharing.  In more practical
terms it's a weekly chance for people to meet, have a meal together and to share
knowledge about their work with music, code and configuring computers. 
This usually happens on Thursdays at 17:00 (CET).

### Clopenness
In topology, a clopen set (a portmanteau of closed-open
set) in a topological space is a set which is both open and closed. That this is
possible may seem counter-intuitive, as the common meanings of open and closed
are antonyms, but their mathematical definitions are not mutually exclusive. A
set is closed if its complement is open, which leaves the possibility of an open
set whose complement is also open, making both sets both open and closed, and
therefore clopen.

### Safe space
The reason C0dereview is clopen is because in order for sharing to be possible
there first needs to be a safe space where people feel comfortable sharing
knowledge with one another. Without trust communication breaks down and nothing
can be learned. When care is taken to foster an environment which is conducive
to learning good things can happen.

### Tools for learning 
The expressed aim of C0dereview is to produce tools for learning through
informal presentations, discussion and experimentation. The dissemination of
knowledge is, in and of it's own self, valuable to us. When we learn from one
another we flourish as a result of that learning.
